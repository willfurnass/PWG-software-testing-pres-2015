# Testing research code: making sure your code does what you want before pressing the big green button

Presentation on software testing given to the [Pennine Water Group](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/penninewatergroup), University of Sheffield.

## Overview ##

1. ...


## Scenario 1

- You've writen some software that takes a long time to run
- One or small number of functions in script
- Crashes after two days :(
- Could use debugger to conduct post-mortem if running locally
- More difficult to do if running on HPC (e.g. [Iceberg](https://www.shef.ac.uk/wrgrid/iceberg))

How could be **more sure in advance** that your code **robustly does the right thing**?


## Scenario 2

- Your code gets increasingly complicated as you learn more about a research problem
- You've written a long script containing a single function and many loops
- You decide to [refactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring) your function as a number of smaller ones, each of which does a well defined thing.

How can you be confident that the new code **produces the same results** as the old code for both 'good' and 'bad' input data?
